# Dotfiles Documentation Rules

## Core Principles

- **Keep documentation clear and comprehensive** - This project should be easy to understand for anyone
- **Always update README.md** when making changes to configurations, tools, or project structure
- **Document what the project is and what it does** - Make the purpose and functionality immediately clear
- **Maintain up-to-date documentation** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs

## When Making Changes

1. **Update README.md** to reflect any new features, tools, or structural changes
2. **Keep the Quick Start section current** with accurate installation instructions
3. **Document system-specific differences** clearly (macOS vs Linux)
4. **Update project structure** when adding/removing files or directories
5. **Explain new tools and their purpose** in the appropriate sections

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear headings and structure
- Include practical examples where helpful
- Keep language simple and direct
- Ensure the README tells the complete story of the project
